Throughout the project, we practically lived there! During our meetings, we coded, conducted code reviews, discussed tasks, and tested our work. I am grateful to my team. Over time, we became very cohesive and managed to structure the process in such a way that any of us could step into another's role if needed. Each one of us delved into each other's tasks but still managed our responsibilities. I appreciate the contribution of every team member; we were able to complete our project primarily due to trust and coordinated teamwork.</p>",
